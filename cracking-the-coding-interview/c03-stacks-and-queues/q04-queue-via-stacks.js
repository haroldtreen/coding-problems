/**
 * Queues and Stacks have different orders for extracting items. To create a
 * queue with stacks we have two stacks, one for inserting items and one for
 * extracting them. When dequeuing an item if the extract stack is empty we
 * use queue operations to pop all the items off the insert stack onto the
 * extract stack which will now be in the right order for a queue.
 *
 * N = |MyQueue|
 * Time: enqueue O(1), dequeue O(N)
 * Additional space: O(N) - to hold the input items
